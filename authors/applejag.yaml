about: |
  Started in web, travelled through game dev, ended up in backend and devops.
  I earn money by writing YAML for work. I'm a glorified YAML engineer.

  Constantly toying with hipster programming languages like [Zig](https://ziglang.org/),
  [CUE](https://cuelang.org/), and [MoonBit](https://www.moonbitlang.com/).

  Author of the [firefly-moon](https://github.com/firefly-zero/firefly-moon) MoonBit SDK for Firefly Zero.
