  You find yourself in a strange new world, unrestricted by the laws of physics
  and populated with surreal beings. Will you be able to find a way home?

  Penroses is a submission for a #bitsyjam themed around the idea of daydreams.
  I was inspired by the dreamy logic of impossible shapes/geometry as well as
  the atmospheric works of Haruki Murakami, Jorge Luis Borges, and Hayao Miyazaki.

  A [bitsy](https://bitsy.org/)-powered game by [rare](https://rarelikeaunicorn.itch.io/).
