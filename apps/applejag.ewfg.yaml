  Manage your horde of adorable fireflies with hardcore names,
  leading them through training to improve their nimbleness and speed.
  Then when you're ready, race them in a tournament against rival fireflies!

  Succeeding will earn you gold, which you can spend in the inexplicably
  Australian wizard frog's shop to purchase additional fireflies,
  vitamins to boost stats or cool hats to adorn your little athletes.
