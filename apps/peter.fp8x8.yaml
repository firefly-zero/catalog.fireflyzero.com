  **Monotone, 8×8px fill patterns**


  A conversion of a small tool I originally wrote
  for the [WASM4](https://wasm4.org/) fantasy console.


  _The patterns were converted from [bitsy](https://bitsy.org/) files found in [8x8.me](https://8x8.me/)
  using a [converter](https://github.com/peterhellberg/w4-8x8-fill-patterns/blob/main/cmd/bitsy-to-w4-sprites/main.go)
  I wrote for the original version of the tool._
